# Setup - Axelofwar Python Bot

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) OR

- **LINUX**:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```

- **MAC**:

```bash
$ brew install python
```

- **WINDOWS**: gotta use the website + .exe lol

2. Install OpenAI

- `pip install openai`

3. Clone this repository

4. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd chatGPT-help-bot
   ```

5. Create a new virtual environment

   ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

6. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

8. Add your [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

9. Add your [Twitter API keys](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) to the `.env` file

10. Add your [Discord token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to the `.env` file

11. Edit config.yml with desired run parameters - the most important are:

- `account_to_query` -> twitter account to track mentions of
- `discord_channel_id` -> default channel if none is entered in UI or permissions not be attained (lower case)
- `prompt` -> details of what question you want to ask chatGPT
- `tweet_history` -> number of tweets from archive you want to pull (more = longer process time)

#

## Run steps by use case

#

12. Run the app for discord history based AI responses

```bash
$ python3 app.py
```

You should now see three .txt files as well as terminal outputs, the .txt files are labeled appropriately:

> - `tweets.txt` holds tweet history info
> - `discord.txt` holds discord channel history info
> - `output.txt` that will hold the chatGPT responses.

### NOTES

Currently only one resposne is stored and replaced each time. This may be changed to preserve response history for better future answering depending on database decisions.

#

13. Run the app for twitter listener bot

```bash
$ python3 utils/filtered_stream.py
```

### NOTES

There are three user's currently identified in the tweet tracking logic of filtered_stream.py

- `author` = originator of the tweet being tracked
- `included` = the author of the tweet included (retweeted, quoted, replied to, mentioned, etc.)
- `engager` = currently should return the same as the above two - as well as any other accounts mentioned in the tweet.
  > _engager_ could be used in the future to reward all users mentioned instead of just author + engager
  > it is currently used to confirm that the author of the included tweet is indeed that author - could be used to reward tweet being engaged more than engager via multiplier as decided.

## OpenAI API Quickstart - Python example app

Here is an example pet name generator app used in the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework. Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up. This example was stripped as a starting place for this project.
