DATA:  Super excited about the alpha updates posted in <#943007407506870323> ! This goes into detail about how I research projects, how I identify projects I think can do well, and buying strategies! TONS of valuable content in there and hopefully more to come!!! 

Right now its super difficult to talk about quantitative analysis of the market and charts due to the overall volatility and the turmoil being experienced around the world (particularly in Russia and Ukraine) - and so I will add more about quantitative market analysis when I see more identifiable trends and the market retraces.

In the meantime hope you guys enjoy the alpha! ‚ù§Ô∏è

DATA:  We're still working! Things may be quiet as I finish up my final exams and approach graduation, but if you're following on twitter you know I'm still active in the space!

When I'm finished with these exams expect some more context and analysis on projects I'm in, looking at, and moves I'm making on other chains!! Check out <#943011412219920415>  for some brief updates!
