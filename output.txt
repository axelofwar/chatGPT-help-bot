Welcome all! Been remaking the discord over the last week so if anything is out of place or broken just lmk!
If you guys have any questions about nfts or crypto or whatever you can ask them here or in the channels and I'll either answer here or take it down to talk about in the stream 🙂
🔥🔥🔥
Thanks again for coming yall! Check out <#943011412219920415>   for some docs about the projects I spoke about! I will be re-visiting NFT Worlds so no worries if you missed it 🙂
Hey all! Just spent some time updating the channels and adding some content with regards to projects I'm watching and interesting discussions I've watched! Check out <#943003619949690941> and <#943007129600671764>  to see some of the new learning! Checkout <#943011412219920415> and <#950065266778337300> if you're looking to start your journey!
Super excited about the alpha updates posted in <#943007407506870323> ! This goes into detail about how I research projects, how I identify projects I think can do well, and buying strategies! TONS of valuable content in there and hopefully more to come!!! 

Right now its super difficult to talk about quantitative analysis of the market and charts due to the overall volatility and the turmoil being experienced around the world (particularly in Russia and Ukraine) - and so I will add more about quantitative market analysis when I see more identifiable trends and the market retraces.

In the meantime hope you guys enjoy the alpha! ❤️
We're still working! Things may be quiet as I finish up my final exams and approach graduation, but if you're following on twitter you know I'm still active in the space!

When I'm finished with these exams expect some more context and analysis on projects I'm in, looking at, and moves I'm making on other chains!! Check out <#943011412219920415>  for some brief updates!
